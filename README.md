# Article: [Anthropic Education Report: How educators use Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-education-report-how-educators-use-claude)

As a longtime follower of Anthropic's research, reading this report got me really excited about where education is heading, especially given my personal connection to the field. Growing up with my mom as a college professor and my dad operating a school in Udaipur, India, I've always been fascinated by education from multiple angles—both the intimate classroom dynamics and the broader institutional challenges. What strikes me most about this research is how it shows professors aren't just adapting to AI—they're genuinely innovating with it. Instead of using Claude as a simple chatbot, educators are building interactive games, custom simulations, and assessment tools that would have taken weeks to create before. I can imagine my mom being intrigued by the possibility of creating those "prohibitively expensive" custom simulations she never had time for, while my dad would probably be excited about the administrative efficiency gains that could free up more resources for actual teaching. What really resonates with me is how thoughtful these educators are being—using AI to handle tedious tasks while preserving the human elements that make education meaningful. Having seen firsthand how much time good teachers spend on administrative work versus actual teaching, this feels like we're witnessing the early stages of a transformation that could genuinely improve both educator wellbeing and student learning experiences.
